The file Week2assignment.html contains the code for the assignment of week 2 of the course.

The files ui.R and server.R contain the code for the Shiny App that was the assignment for week 4. The result can be seen on the shinyapps.io web site (https://tmr285.shinyapps.io/BostonPredictor/).

The file 'Documentation My Boston House Value Predictor App.txt' contains the documentation for the end user of the Shiny App, although the app is not that complicated.
